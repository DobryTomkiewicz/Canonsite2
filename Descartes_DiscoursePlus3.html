If you read the discourse on method, it only makes sense to read it in the form it was originally published, knowing it was only intended as the preface to a larger work. It’s intriguing, because there are both a number of forward thinking insights and great errors. For example, he claims that he solved the cause of birthmarks as being the result of sunlight reflecting off of the blood and burning the infant. There is no evidence for this particular claim. He seems to have simply thought it and then refused to doubt it.

The main famous claim is that this book invented to coordinate system. While the idea is there and the combination of algebra with geometry is arguably one of the single most important contributions to mathematics, the IJK “Cartesian” coordinate system does not appear. This didn’t emerge in its final form until a textbook based on lecturesby Gibbs all the way in 1901. The exact notation for vector analysis was a large debate over centuries. Interestingly, if one reads this Vector Analysis book, one find all the notation exactly the same. It is worth reading for this alone. I am unable to find another example of so much notation introduced and turned consensus by one book alone. From this influence, it is also necessarily a thorough and complete description of vector analysis, and I would recommend anyone confused by the subject to track that work down.
