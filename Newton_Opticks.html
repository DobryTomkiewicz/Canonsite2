    <h2>Commentary</h2>
    <p>
      <!-- Insert your commentary here -->
      The first part is a set up to explain that "Pure white light" is not pure, but rather that particular colors of light make up white light. He then describes how this fact can be used to construct better telescopes. (The first of three parts of Principia Mathematica laments that the theories constructed can only be so precise due to limitations in telescope resolution. So Newton worked on that problem.) Then the text sort of breaks down into a series of open questions that Newton couldn't resolve, revealing just how thoroughly he was considering the topics at hand. This became a philosophical model for later scientists, particularly Benjamin Franklin, who based a lot of his methodology for electrical experiments off his reading of this book.
