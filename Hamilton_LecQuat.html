    <h2>Commentary</h2>
    <p>
      <!-- Insert your commentary here -->
      Quaternions are a way of modeling 3d objects which are considered slightly more difficult than modern vector methods but can avoid a certain problem called “Gimbal lock” which shows up in the mathematical expression of vectors.

As for this work, it is over 800 pages and consists of 7 lectures, the last one being over 300 pages long. Did Hamilton actually give this lecture? There are remarks at the start of earlier ones where he apologizes to the audience for giving lectures that are too long.

As for the writing itself, in some ways it is very clear. However, I have never read anything that uses as many semicolons as this. Every sentence has multiple. Sentences go on for pages.
