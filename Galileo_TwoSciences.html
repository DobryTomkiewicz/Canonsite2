Einstein once remarked that Galileo is the true starter of modern science (Note to self, find the exact quote) but up until this point in his career, he is mostly known for his arguments defending Copernicus. But this is where Galileo breaks into his own and makes nearly all of his most important discoveries. It is an astonishing feat of science and surprising considering it is not written in standard form. Instead galileo delivers this as a dialogue. 
So many modern discussions are had in this book, from experiments discussing the speed of light, the xistence of atoms, a refutation of aristotle’s mechanics that leads to importance of tangent lines for describing motion. 
The most famous passage is the experiment where two balls are dropped off the leaning tower of pisa (He doesn’t name the tower in the work itself) however the actual story had a number of different results than the version I was familiar with from school
He claims that Aristotle did perform the experiment himself. He also claims that the two balls do fall at different rates. The disagreement with Aristotle comes with the claim that objects fall “Proportional” to their weight. However, the subtle difference in times is not proportional, as objects ten times as heavy do not fall ten times as fast. However, when Galileo repeated the experiment in water, he found objects do fall proportional to their weight. This means that the subtle difference in fall times is due to air behaving like a fluid. In order to test this, Galileo describes how one can build a vacuum chamber in order to prove that air has mass and that vacuums are actually possible in nature. 
There’s a lot more to this work. There’s a discussion of music theory, and a series of proofs around projectile motion. The two “New” sciences are “Fracture Mechanics” and “Motion.” Students today will be introduced to them in undergrad as “Mechanics of Solids” and “Dynamics.” However, don’t try reading this book to study for an exam.
