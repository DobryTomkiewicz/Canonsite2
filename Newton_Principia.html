    <h2>Commentary</h2>
    <p>
      <!-- Insert your commentary here -->
Many words are written on this book, and despite this, very few people have actually tried to read it, resulting in a large amount of misinformation. I’ll only attempt to address some of the rumours about it
The work is only about 100,000 words long, roughly the length of the hunger games, yet it is still considered too much effort to read even by professional physicists. I would argue it is the most impenetrable surviving scientific work out there (at least, not counting all the insignificant alchemy works written in code)
Newton essentially expects the reader to have all the ancient Greek works memorized. Obscure results from the conics of Apollonius are simply alluded to as consensus. 
It’s a common interpretation that Newton felt he needed to write in the formal style of the ancient greeks to be accepted by society. I don’t personally buy this, as none of the contemporary books to his time on this list are written in the same formal style as newton. That was his own prerogative. 
Despite the opaque nature of his writing, there’s a lot of historical context which can be gleaned from this work, and I think reading it is essential to know exactly what he was trying to do and what things he still left undone. Much of the math after this was written to tie into Newton’s models, so without understanding them, one is left looking at terminology wondering “Why is that part there?” Is that really the best way to approach this problem?”
