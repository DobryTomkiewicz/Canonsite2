     Within 300 pages, Copernicus creates an entire model of the solar system similar to Ptolemy’s Almagest, yet Copernicus’s model is so simple that, instead of the intricate curves of Ptolemy’s model, Copernicus builds it out of perfect circles.
Out of context it’s easy to be simply impressed with his insight (or disappointed that he didn’t use ellipses, but remember that Copernicus didn’t even have a telescope, and the elliptical orbits of the visible planets are all very nearly circular) however after looking at the historical context I have more questions than answers.
The heliocentric model was first described by aristarchus. We don’t have Aristarchus’s original writings of this, but we do have Archimedes’s criticism of Aristarchus in his paper “The Sand Reckoner.” Ptolemy’s geocentric model came centuries later, however Aristotle mentions something similar.
<!-- There actually are mathematical reasons for believing earth does not move (Archimedes was not basing his refutations on superstition or Christian dogma, partially because Christianity did not yet exist.). A solid explanation of this “Stellar parallax” problem was given by Mathematician Terence Tao in the following youtube video: 
(Note to self, remember to find that youtube video) -->
However this means that the mathematical techniques and epistemological motivation to coordinate transform Ptolemy’s geocentric model into a heliocentric model already existed for over a thousand years before Copernicus. If anyone had tried that, even for simple curiosity, they would have noticed the clear circular pattern arise instead of the intricate epicycle pattern, yet it seems no one took care to actually do this for over a millenium.
<!-- It raises a number of questions about the attitude toward mathematics during the Dark Ages. -->
<!-- The obvious candidate is censorship by the church. While people know the story of Galileo’s trials, it doesn’t seem copernicus’s ideas were met with much hostility until Galileo came along. Robert Recorde complimented Copernicus only a few years after the initial publication. Kepler also adopted a heliocentric model right away from his first publication in 1596.  -->
