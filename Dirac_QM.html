    <h2>Commentary</h2>
    <p>
      <!-- Insert your commentary here -->
The first full book work on quantum mechanics. This is obviously significant in the history of science. 
<!-- It is often stated that “No one can understand quantum mechanics.” What could this possibly mean? If no one could understand it, then how are there classes teaching it? What is meant by the word “Understand?” -->
<!-- Dirac gives a similar idea in this text but stated slightly differently. He says this is a theory “Which we can form no visual picture.” The book itself is presented with no diagrams. -->
<!-- Of course there are people who have tried to give visual pictures since then, however these fall into the category of “Interpretations of quantum mechanics,” as the theory itself does not provide enough information to draw pictures accurately of what’s going on.
I would prefer if “No visual picture” was stated instead of “We cant understand it.” Such a description allows quantum mechanics, and as a result all of science, to be abused by con artists into supporting dadaist fantastic claims.  -->
