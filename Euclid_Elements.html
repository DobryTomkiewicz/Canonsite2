    <h2>Commentary</h2>
    <p>
      <!-- Insert your commentary here -->
The most important math book ever written. Also as far as I can tell, this is the oldest complete book on mathematics that is still extant.

Despite this, it was still used as a textbook up until the twentieth century. This should indicate the feature that makes math particularly useful: It doesn’t change based on time or cultural context. While most of the scientific results of Ancient Greece appear insane to us today, the mathematical results are still just as valid. Within math, problems can be resolved definitively and remain resolved. That the human mind is capable of such a task is worth noting before considering philosophical arguments about the tenuous nature of reality. A window is open indicating that these problems are truly solvable if their solution method uses mathematics as its basis for finding results. 

As for the work itself it clearly tackles questions which were already existing and being debated before it. The simplest concept involving math is arguably numbers, but that is not the approach Euclid takes, waiting until Book 7 of 13 before even introducing the concept of number. (Still, division and multiplication of segments into thirds and so on are done earlier, indicating that the intended reader is likely expected to already be familiar with these concepts)
