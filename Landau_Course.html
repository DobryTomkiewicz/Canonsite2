    <h2>Commentary</h2>
    <p>
      <!-- Insert your commentary here -->
     The most important work ever produced by civilization? I would vouch for this. Have I read all of it? Absolutely not. This is, apparently, the closest thing to a complete encyclopedia of physics, given with enough detail and rigor to be a complete explanation of the behavior. Decades after its completion it is still used by researchers. Every subsection has enough detail to make a career out of it. 

It is sometimes said that you need to know a lot of physics to understand it, but in my opinion it is more important to know math. While there is variation across the volumes, subjects are typically walked through by showing the most complete intricate form of the equation in question, and then walking through its derivations physically, not mathematically, so that you can understand where the each chunk of the equation fits in as a phenomena. This means that you can use these explanations for experiments way outside any original intention by the authors, because you can figure out each potentially important interacting phenomena and figure out what factors are essential to control for depending on what intended phenomena you want to emerge. It is so frustrating finding other books which purport to be at the graduate level and still will skip steps claiming this or that topic is too difficult to deal with. It means you can’t use the book for an original idea in the lab, because how are you supposed to control for an emergent phenomenon if you don’t even have a description of it? But Landau doesn’t have that problem. Every time I’ve found some strange derivation in a paper, in my limited experience, I’ve found some explanation in Landau. Even if it was a bit terse, it’s a good starting place. It feel like looking “Under the hood” of some easier-to-understand simplified model.
