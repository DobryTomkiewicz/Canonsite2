      <!-- Insert your commentary here -->
Interesting work on metalworking. Beautiful and haunting woodcut illustrations of power machinery. However, this is before concepts like chemical energy were understood, so all of the machinery is either human or animal powered. It all looks like a series of torture devices. It’s good to keep in mind if someone speaks ill of the industrial revolution and its consequences, this is the real alternative. It wouldn’t look anything like something Tolkien would come up with.
Another interesting feature is, when listing potential hazards workers could run into, Agricola goes on a tangent about a particularly interesting danger: Gnomes.
The translator notes this, and seems lukewarm about the potential existence of gnomes. This translator was future American President Herbert Hoover. There are transcripts of him giving speeches about Gnomes in Moscow.
