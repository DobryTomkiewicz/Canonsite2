The goal of this is a chronological list of important works in the mathematical sciences. 
There is a fair amount of public interest in this topic however most lists of "Great Books 
of Science" will also throw in pop science works as well as bad philosophy. This is an 
attempt to correct that. It is still incomplete. Several more works must be added, including 
Archimedes, other works by Hero of Alexandria, William Gilbert, Carnot, Galois, etc. Several 
existing pages also still need to be filled out. Since this is an html hopefully it can be 
downloaded locally and browsed from the "Homepage Sample" file. Although more sophisticated 
changes will need to be made, as it does not yet display clearly on all devices.
